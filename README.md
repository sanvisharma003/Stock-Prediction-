Welcome to the Stock Prediction Analysis project! This project aims to study and
 evaluate various machine learning algorithms for predicting stock prices based on
 historical data encompassing both NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE
 (Bombay Stock Exchange) data.
 
 # Features:
 
 # Prediction Algorithms:
 
 ● Linear Regression
 
 ● LSTM(LongShort-Term Memory)
 
 ● RandomForestRegressor
 
 ● ARIMA(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
 
 # Sentiment Analysis:
 
 ● Utilizes VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) for
 sentiment analysis of recent news articles related to the stock.
 
 # Recommendation:
 ● Provides recommendations based on combined results of prediction
 algorithms and sentiment analysis to predict the upward or downward
 trend in stock prices over the short-term.
 
 # Technologies Used:
 
 This project utilizes a combination of frontend and backend technologies to provide
 a comprehensive solution. Here's an overview of the technologies employed:
 
 # Frontend
 
 ●HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the
 content and layout of web pages, providing the foundation for the user
 interface.
 
 ●CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is utilized for styling and designing the
 user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent presentation
 across the web application.
 
# Backend
 
● Flask(Python): Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, is used for
 backend development. It provides the necessary tools and libraries for
 building web applications, handling requests, and managing data.
 
 # Algorithm Implementation
 
 Python programming language is used to implement various machine
 learning algorithms for stock prediction analysis. Libraries such as pandas,
 numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and keras are employed for data
 manipulation, preprocessing, and algorithm implementation.
 
 # Setup Instructions:
 
 1. Clone the Repository:
 Use git clone <repository_url> to clone the project repository.

 2. Install Dependencies:
 Run pip install-r requirements.txt to install the required
 libraries.

 3. Running the Application:
 ● Navigate to the project directory.

 ● RuntheFlask server using python filename.py.
 
 ● Accesstheapplication through the provided URL.
 
 # Future Enhancements:
 
 ● Enhancedataintegration by incorporating additional sources such as
 sentiment analysis, economic indicators, and news sentiment to enrich
 predictive models.
 
 ● Refinemachinelearning algorithms and optimize their performance to
 improve prediction accuracy, ensuring more reliable forecasts for both NSE
 and BSE stocks.

 # Here's how to run the stock prediction analysis for NSE and BSE data on your local machine:
 
 # Steps to Run the Project for Stock Prediction Analysis:
 
 Install Required Dependencies:
 
 ● EnsurePython is installed on your system.
 
 ● Install necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib,
 scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow, flask, and others. You can install them
 using pip.
 
 Clone the Repository:
 ● Clonethestock prediction analysis project repository from the provided
 URL.
 
 Prepare Data:
 
 ● Ensureyouhavethe historical stock price data for NSE and BSE in CSV
 format.
 
 ● PlacetheCSVfiles in the designated directory within the project.
 Run the Flask Server:
 
 ● Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
 
 ● RuntheFlask server using the command python app.py.
 
 Access the Web Interface:
 
 ● OncetheFlask server is running, open a web browser and go to the
 specified localhost address and port where the Flask server is hosted.
 Input Stock Symbol and Preferences:
 
 ● Enterthe stock symbol and select the desired analysis options.
 View Results:
 
 ● After choosing the company ticker , wait for the analysis to complete.
 
 ● Oncedone,the results will be displayed on the web interface to choose
 for NSE or BSE.
 
 Interpret Results:
 
 ● Analyzethe predicted stock prices, sentiment analysis, and
 recommendations provided by the application.
 
 Further Testing and Optimization:
 
 ● Testvarious stock symbols, experiment with different parameters, and
 explore the application's features thoroughly.
 
With these steps, you can run the stock prediction analysis for NSE and BSE data
 locally on your machine for insightful stock market predictions. If you encounter
 any difficulties during the setup process, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.
